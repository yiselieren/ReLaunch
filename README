ReLaunch - filemanager / launcher for Nook Simple Touch.

This is a simple filenamager and/or launcher for Nook Simple Touch. It calls
predefined reader on file selection, In addition it has task manager, task killer,
application manager and file viewer/editor functionality.

The tool is able to work in two modes:

1. Application mode
===================
When ReLaunch is invoked from other launcher (technically speaking when it
invoked using main intent - android.intent.action.MAIN) it works in application mode.

1.1 filemanager
---------------
You see a directory structure, you can walk on it. Tap on directory name to go into
the directory, tap on ".." labeled line to go one directory up.

1.2 on-file actions, single tap
-------------------------------
When you tap on regular file (not a directory) the ReLaunch may perform a few actions, depending
on you settings (see 1.4 for settings details)

- call explicit package or create intent for that file if such action is defined in
  Settings->Associations screen
- for .apk file - install it
- for any other file - open viewer (if file is small enough, see 1.4). Note
  that editor can be opened from the viewer
- do nothing if file is too big for viewer and association for that file not found

1.3 on-file actions, long tap
-----------------------------
On long tap context menu is opened. The file can be added to favorites, marked as read (we
are speaking about ebooks, isn't it?) or removed (with confirmations, see 1.4).
Note that directories can be removed too, even recursively. Be careful!

1.4 settings (first from left button on top panel)
--------------------------------------------------
Some application-wide settings. Pay attention to "Filter settings" and "Association".

Filter settings defines which files are visible in file manager. If you define some rules there do not
forget to switch on "Filter result" checkbox in general settings section.

Association defines action which performs on file tap (according to file's extension)

1.5 search (second from left button on top panel
------------------------------------------------
You can search files (books) from any root by some patterns. Note "Show all books" button. By pressing
it you see all files with known extension (see 1.4 associations).

1.6 last opened files list (third from left button on top panel)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Each file opened by ReLaunch remembered in last opened files (LIFO order).

1.7 favorites list (fourth from left button on top panel
--------------------------------------------------------
You can manage favorites list by adding / removing books to it.

1.8 about (fifth from left button on top panel)
-----------------------------------------------
Application info


2. Launcher mode
================
When ReLanuch is invoked by pressing "Home" (in a NookSimpleTouch case by SoftKey
"home" button), or by pressing "Nook button - > Shop" or "Nook button - > Library" it
works in launcher mode. In that mode it has all standard launcher functionality (task
manager / application manager) in addition to application mode possibilities described above.

Launcher mode functionality:
- Task manager (tap on memory status, first left bottom button)
- Last used applications (second left bottom button)
- All applications (third left bottom button)
  You can launch application by taping on it, or uninstall it by
  long tap (context menu opened)
- Favorites applications (fourth left bottom button)
- Battery status (tap on memory status, fifth left bottom button)


Notes
=====
Note 1: I build it in debug mode using eclipse. Do not forget to copy
debug.keystore to ~/.android in order to be compatible with old version
