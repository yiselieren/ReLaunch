gamba69@gmail.com: I left the project for an indefinite period... sorry.

==========
CASUAL
- add more "smart" buttons (change first screen buttons behavior and configuration)
	-- for search button: search with input only search string, repeat last search (without confirmations), open search window
- (NOT POPULATED, BEFORE 1.3!!!) add screens for "Help" and "Appreciation" (with links, for example, to CoolReader, icons lib pack and so on).
FUTURE >1.3
- (delayed at least for 1.3) may be some extended functionality for advanced screen (i.e. start to configure selected WiFi net, for example)
- (delayed at least for 1.3) add manual scrolling for Sony devices
